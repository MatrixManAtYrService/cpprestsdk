I created this fork to aide in troubleshooting, it contains two samples not in Microsoft's version.  Unless you're interested in my half baked samples, you probably want the [Microsoft version](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk).

My samples are called HelloWorldListener and HelloWorldSpeaker. Run the listener first, then run the speaker.  The speaker will show you what it's serializing ("Hello  World!").  The listener should recieve it and display the string.
